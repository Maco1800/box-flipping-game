# Box Flipping Game

## Introduction

First, I was inspired by a Fastrack smartwatch game called "Discoloration." After not being able to find it to play online,I decided to create my own version of it. While it may not have advanced features, it's functional and fun to play. Used AI to build

## How to Play

- The game consists of a grid of boxes that can be toggled on or off by clicking on them.
- When you click on a box, the box itself and its adjacent boxes (above, below, left, and right) will toggle their state.
- The goal of each level is to turn on (make green) all the boxes in the grid.
- You start with a 2x2 grid in the first level, and each new level adds rows to the left and right of the grid.
